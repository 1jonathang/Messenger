`Messenger` is my second major project used to learn web development. Designed in NextJS leveraging Redis as my database, NextAuth for user authentication
and Pusher for realtime updates within the app.

This app is mostly finished, with more ideas and better styling that I am intending to add in the coming future (dark mode, user profile pages, etc.)
