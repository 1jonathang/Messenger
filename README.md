`Messenger` is my second major project used to learn web development. 

..* Designed in NextJS leveraging Redis as my database, NextAuth for user authentication
and Pusher for realtime updates within the app.

..* Throughout the development of this project, I learned so much about producing a *serious* application. 

..* Implementing user authentication through NextAuth and database implementation with Redis was first experience for me.

..* Alongside utlising TailwindCSS and creating functional components for case speicific styling, 
there were many instances where I used Typescripts type safety features
to create interfaces and custom types for better code practices.

..* This app is mostly finished, with more ideas and better styling that I am intending to add in the coming future (dark mode, user profile pages, etc.)
