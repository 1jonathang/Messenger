`Messenger` is my second major project used to learn web development. 

+ Designed in NextJS leveraging Redis as my database, NextAuth for user authentication  
and Pusher for realtime updates within the app.

+ Throughout the development of this project, I learned so much about producing a *serious* application. 

+ Implementing user authentication through NextAuth and database implementation with Redis was first experience for me.

+ Alongside utlising TailwindCSS and creating functional components for case speicific styling,   
there were many instances where I used Typescripts type safety features  
to create interfaces and custom types for better code practices.  

+ This app is mostly finished, with more ideas and better styling that I am intending to add in the coming future (dark mode, user profile pages, etc.)

## Features
`Messenger` contains many features that you would see in any modern day messaging app.  
Using Pusher, real time notifications are displayed to the user of a new message from  
a user they're friends with.

A very user friendly sidebar is shown throughout the entire application to display the user current friends,  
and options to send and see current friend requests
